# Note: Test-specific dependencies like coverage, pytest, factory-boy,
# django-test-plus are managed in requirements/test.txt
# and are included when running tests, typically via tox or a CI setup.
# Including them here would be redundant if `test.txt` is also installed.
# If this local environment is also used for running tests directly
# without a separate test requirements installation, then uncommenting
# the -r test.txt line below might be desired.
